#Lab about sockets
####It is necessary to develop a program where pressing the key combination Ctrl + A starts the first flow, Ctrl + B - the second flow. At the same time, the values ​​of the function y = sin (x) begin to be calculated in the first stream, and the values ​​of the function y = cos (x) in the second stream. This data is transmitted over the local network using the TCP / IP protocol to another program that receives the data and displays it on the same graph with lines of different colors and textures. Pressing Ctrl + N should stop the data transfer in the first two streams and the second application should output the amount of data received for each graph. This data must be stored in the register and it must be possible to view this data until two threads are started again, which will generate new sequences of data.
